### Patch Changes

- `patchConvexTsconfig` no longer injects `baseUrl` into `convex/tsconfig.json` — it's deprecated
  in TypeScript 6/7 and errors under `moduleResolution: "Bundler"`. A `baseUrl` of exactly `"."`
  left over from an older scaffold is now actively deleted (self-heal for already-scaffolded
  alpha.2 projects). The patcher also now ensures `../src/vex.types.ts` is listed in `include` —
  Convex rewrites this file on every provisioning pass and would otherwise drop it, making the
  project's `GeneratedVexTypes` module augmentation invisible to the convex program.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- Drop per-collection Convex file generation (`generateCollectionFiles`, and the call to it from
  `vex generate`/`vex dev`). The emitted `convex/vex/api/*` and `convex/vex/model/api/*` files had
  no consumers under the factory-registered runtime API (`collectionsApi` et al.) — `vex
generate`/`vex dev` now only write `vex.schema.ts` and `vex.types.ts`.

  BREAKING: a project relying on the generated per-collection query/mutation files must migrate to
  the factory-registered API exposed by `@vexcms/core`. Bumped `minor` rather than `major` —
  these packages are pre-1.0 alpha.

- 07924de: Per-call `access: { action?, bypass? }` options on every server API function and
  `vexServerApi` wrapper, resolved through a single `resolveAccessCall` seam. Custom
  actions gain their first runtime consumer; `readDrafts` rides the same seam for the
  upcoming versioning feature. `vex generate` emits `CustomActionsBySlug`, and
  `QueryCallActionFor`/`MutationCallActionFor` type `access.action` per collection slug.

  BREAKING: `defaultPermissionMode` is removed from `VexAccessConfigInput` — the
  undeclared-permission posture is always deny; write a role-level `"*": true` for
  allow-style roles. `skipAccess` on `vexServerApi` is replaced by `access: { bypass: true }`.

### Patch Changes

- fb55d58: Publish `peerDependencies` as ranges instead of exact versions.

  `peerDependencies` previously inherited exact versions from the pnpm catalog, so
  installing alongside a newer `convex`, `lucide-react`, or `@tanstack/react-table`
  produced a peer conflict. Peers now resolve from a dedicated `peers` catalog of
  deliberate ranges, and `@vexcms/core` is peered as a compatible range rather
  than an exact version. `dependencies` are now published as exact versions instead of ranges
  (`nanoid: 5.1.16`, not `^5.1.11`), so an install cannot silently pick up a
  different transitive tree than the one tested.

  `@vexcms/next` now declares `next >=15.0.0`, correcting a `>=14.0.0` claim that
  never held — the admin page awaits `params`, which requires Next 15 typings.

- bde8141: Enforce the `adminPanel` access gate, fix two authorization defects, and add a single switch for
  turning RBAC off.

  - `@vexcms/core`: new `canAccessAdminPanel()` answers the `adminPanel.access` gate without
    callers hand-typing the subject and action — nothing consulted that subject before, so any
    authenticated caller reached the admin panel regardless of the matrix. `defineAccess()` gains
    `enabled` (default `true`), checked inside `hasPermission`, so one field on the resolved config
    turns access control off for the server guards and the admin UI together. **Security fix:**
    `update` authorized against the caller-supplied patch rather than the stored document, letting
    a per-document rule be satisfied by the request body; it now fetches and checks the stored row,
    matching `get`/`find`/`remove`. `deleteMedia` now passes the stored document too, so
    per-document delete rules are satisfiable.
  - `@vexcms/react`: new `UnauthorizedView` for callers who fail an access check. `Button` gains
    `aria-disabled:*` variants so a link-rendered button (`nativeButton={false}`) actually greys
    out and stops responding — `disabled:*` never matched the rendered `<a>`. `CollectionListView`
    had its create button's `disabled` prop inverted; bulk delete is now permission-gated in both
    the collection and media list views.
  - `@vexcms/cli`: removed the unimplemented `schema/generateSchema.ts` stub (superseded by core's
    `generateVexSchema`, and already excluded from the package's own test run). JSDoc completed
    across the package; a `pushSchemaStandalone` description that claimed to run `convex deploy`
    now matches its actual `dev --once` behavior.
  - `@vexcms/better-auth`, `@vexcms/richtext-plate`, `create-vexcms`: JSDoc completed on exported
    symbols; unused imports and bindings removed. No behavior changes.

- 9e68058: Ship type declarations. Published packages contained no `.d.ts` at all.

  Every `tsup.config.ts` carried `dts: false` — tsup's rollup-dts pegs the CPU on this
  dependency graph — so `types: "./dist/index.d.ts"` pointed at a file that was never
  emitted. Installing any `@vexcms/*` package gave you `any`.

  Declarations now come from `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --emitDeclarationOnly`, run after
  tsup in each package's `build` script. `dts: false` stays, deliberately: tsup builds JS,
  tsc builds types.

  The blocker was TS6059 (`File is not under rootDir`). Workspace deps resolved through the
  `source` export condition, pulling sibling `src/` into each program. The build configs now
  set `"customConditions": []` so deps resolve through their published `types` entry
  instead; Turbo's `dependsOn: ["^build"]` guarantees upstream `dist/` exists first. Dev
  configs are untouched and still resolve through `source`.

  Also exports `AuthFieldMeta` from `@vexcms/core`. `@vexcms/better-auth` had been importing
  it through `../../core/src/auth/types`, a cross-package source path that cannot produce a
  correct declaration.

- b67c8ab: Publish under Apache-2.0 with full package metadata.

  Every published manifest now carries `license: "Apache-2.0"` (root `LICENSE` +
  `NOTICE` added), `description`, `keywords`, `author`, `homepage`, and
  `repository` with per-package `directory`. `sideEffects: false` is declared
  where verified side-effect-free; `@vexcms/next` declares `["*.css"]` because it
  exports `./styles`. Packages publish to the `alpha` dist-tag
  (`publishConfig.tag`), leaving `latest` untouched until promotion.
